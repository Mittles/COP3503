Windows Devs:
I still recommend using Github's client for Windows.
Clone or pull the repo, run setup-dev-win32.bat as your user. Make sure you've no other version of Code-Blocks installed first. It will prompt you to install once downloaded, be patient as the IDE is rather large.

The win32_lib.zip file may be removed at a later date, it contains a patch from upstream to fix usage on Code::Blocks. See: stackover/winapifamily-h-no-such-file-or-directory-when-compiling-sdl-in-codeblocks

Linux Devs:
Wait I'm the only one. If you're not in our group, you can either build SDL like the setup-dev-linux.sh script or install libsdl-dev for your distro.

OSX Devs:
Install a Code::Blocks build from http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/MacOS/CodeBlocks-13.12-mac.zip/download The setup-dev-linux.sh script should work for you for the rest of it - I'll finish sorting this out by the end of the week. Don't forget to set it up to use GCC 4.8.
